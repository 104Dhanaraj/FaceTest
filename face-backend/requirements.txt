# MIGRATION NOTE: As of [MIGRATION DATE], this backend exclusively uses MobileFaceNet (via DeepFace) for all face embedding and recognition. ArcFace, FaceNet, ssd_mobilenetv1, and face_landmark_68 are deprecated and must not be referenced. KNN (scikit-learn) is the sole classifier. See README for details.
